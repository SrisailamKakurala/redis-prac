## üìö Redis Beginner Notes

### 1.1 **Introduction to Redis**

#### What is Redis?
Redis is an open-source, **in-memory data structure store**. It's designed for high performance and versatility. Redis can be used as:
- **Database**: Stores data in memory for fast access.
- **Cache**: Improves speed by temporarily holding frequently accessed data.
- **Message Broker**: Facilitates communication between applications (via Pub/Sub).

#### Why Use Redis?
- **Speed**: As an in-memory store, Redis is incredibly fast compared to traditional disk-based databases.
- **Data Structures**: Redis offers a variety of **data types** like strings, lists, sets, hashes, and more, allowing for flexible solutions.
- **Scalability**: Redis is highly scalable, supporting **horizontal partitioning** (sharding) and **replication**.
- **Real-Time Use Cases**: It's perfect for applications requiring **real-time processing**, such as chat apps, live data feeds, etc.

#### Redis Use Cases
- **Caching**: Store frequently used data for quick access (e.g., user sessions, product details).
- **Queues**: Implement job queues for task scheduling (e.g., background processing).
- **Leaderboard Systems**: Use sorted sets to track and rank user scores.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Store counters and statistics for instant updates.

### 1.2 **Setting Up Redis**

#### Installation
To get started with Redis, you need to install it on your machine.

##### üñ•Ô∏è On Linux/macOS:
```bash
# For Ubuntu-based Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```
Redis should now be running in the background.

##### üñ•Ô∏è On Windows:
1. Download and install Redis from [Redis Windows download](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases).
2. Extract the files and run Redis using `redis-server.exe`.

#### Redis CLI: The Basics
The **Redis CLI** is a command-line interface to interact with the Redis server. Some of the most common commands include:
- `SET key value`: Stores the value for a key.
- `GET key`: Retrieves the value of the specified key.
- `DEL key`: Deletes the specified key.

Redis is now set up and ready to be used for all your caching, real-time, and data storage needs!

---

### 1.3 **Redis CLI - Working with Containers**

#### Starting Redis Stack Container

**Development Environment**:
To quickly start a Redis Stack container for development, run the following command:
```bash
docker run -d --name redis-stack -p 6379:6379 -p 8001:8001 redis/redis-stack:latest
```
- This will run Redis Stack with web UI on port `8001` and Redis on port `6379`.

**Production Environment**:
For production, it's recommended to use the Redis Stack server container:
```bash
docker run -d --name redis-stack-server -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```
- This container will run Redis on port `6379` without the web UI for production-ready environments.

#### Opening the Bash Shell in Redis Container (Interactive Mode)

To access the container‚Äôs shell in an interactive mode, use the following command:
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
```
- Replace `<container_id>` with the ID or name of your running Redis container. This will give you access to the Redis CLI inside the container.

### 1.3 **Basic Redis CLI Commands**

#### Redis Data Types Overview

Redis supports various **data types**, which are used for different use cases. Understanding how to interact with these types is crucial for efficiently using Redis in production.

- **String**: The most basic data type, used for storing text, numbers, or binary data.
- **List**: Ordered collections of strings. Can be used as a queue or stack.
- **Set**: Unordered collections of unique strings.
- **Hash**: Key-value pairs, suitable for storing objects (e.g., user profiles).
- **Sorted Set**: A set of unique elements ordered by a score, useful for leaderboards or priority queues.

#### 1.3.1 **Working with Strings** (Basic Key-Value Store)

Strings are the simplest data type in Redis, and they are essential for caching and session storage.

##### Set a String:
```bash
SET mykey "Hello, Redis!"
```
- This stores `"Hello, Redis!"` under the key `mykey`.

##### Get a String:
```bash
GET mykey
```
- This retrieves the value stored under the `mykey` key, which is `"Hello, Redis!"`.

##### Set Expiry on a Key:
```bash
EXPIRE mykey 3600
```
- Sets an expiration time of **1 hour** (3600 seconds) for `mykey`. In production, this is used for session management and caching. Redis will automatically delete keys after the specified time.

##### Example: Cache with Expiration
In a production-grade web app, caching the results of a time-consuming database query is common. You might cache the query result for 10 minutes:
```bash
SET product_details:123 "{...}"
EXPIRE product_details:123 600  # Cache expires in 10 minutes
```

##### Check Key's Time to Live (TTL):
```bash
TTL mykey
```
- Returns the time (in seconds) remaining before the key expires. It returns `-1` if no expiry is set and `-2` if the key doesn't exist.

---

#### 1.3.2 **Working with Lists** (Queues and Stacks)

Redis Lists are great for implementing queues and stacks. In production, they are widely used in task queues (e.g., background jobs, message brokers).

##### Push to a List:
```bash
LPUSH queue "task1"
RPUSH queue "task2"
```
- `LPUSH` adds items to the **left** of the list (stack behavior).
- `RPUSH` adds items to the **right** of the list (queue behavior).

##### Pop from a List:
```bash
LPOP queue  # Retrieves and removes the first element (task1)
RPOP queue  # Retrieves and removes the last element (task2)
```
- `LPOP` and `RPOP` remove items from the list and return the value. They are essential for processing tasks in a queue.

##### Example: Background Job Queue (Production-Grade)
In production, background job processing can be managed with a Redis-backed queue:
```bash
LPUSH job_queue "task1"
LPUSH job_queue "task2"
```
Workers can then pop jobs and process them:
```bash
LPOP job_queue  # Process task1
```

---

#### 1.3.3 **Working with Sets** (Unique Collections)

Sets are useful for maintaining unique collections of elements. In production, they are ideal for handling user lists, unique tags, etc.

##### Add to a Set:
```bash
SADD user:123:tags "redis" "database" "cache"
```
- `SADD` adds one or more members to a set. The set will automatically ignore duplicates.

##### Retrieve Members of a Set:
```bash
SMEMBERS user:123:tags
```
- `SMEMBERS` returns all members of the set.

##### Check if Member Exists in a Set:
```bash
SISMEMBER user:123:tags "redis"
```
- Returns `1` if `"redis"` is a member of the set, otherwise `0`.

---

#### 1.3.4 **Working with Hashes** (Key-Value Pairs)

Hashes are perfect for storing objects. A common use case in production is storing user profiles, settings, etc.

##### Set Fields in a Hash:
```bash
HSET user:123 name "John Doe" age "30" email "john@example.com"
```
- `HSET` stores multiple field-value pairs in a hash under the key `user:123`.

##### Get Fields from a Hash:
```bash
HGET user:123 name  # Returns "John Doe"
HGETALL user:123  # Returns all fields and values
```
- `HGET` retrieves a specific field from the hash.
- `HGETALL` returns all fields and values in the hash.

##### Example: Storing User Profiles in Production
```bash
HSET user:123 name "Jane Doe" email "jane@example.com" role "admin"
```
In production, you might use hashes to store user profile data. Redis makes it easy to update only a field:
```bash
HSET user:123 email "newemail@example.com"
```

---

#### 1.3.5 **Working with Sorted Sets** (Ranked Data)

Sorted Sets are used to store elements with scores, making them ideal for leaderboards, queues with priorities, etc.

##### Add to a Sorted Set:
```bash
ZADD leaderboard 100 "Alice" 200 "Bob" 150 "Charlie"
```
- `ZADD` adds members with scores to a sorted set, automatically ordering them.

##### Retrieve Members by Rank:
```bash
ZRANGE leaderboard 0 -1  # Returns members ordered by score (Alice, Charlie, Bob)
```

##### Example: Leaderboard System
In production, you might use sorted sets to rank players based on their scores:
```bash
ZADD leaderboard 500 "Alice" 300 "Bob" 400 "Charlie"
ZRANGE leaderboard 0 -1  # Returns ["Alice", "Charlie", "Bob"]
```

---

#### 1.3.6 **Working with MSET and MGET** (Bulk Operations)

In production-grade applications, working with multiple keys at once can significantly improve performance.

##### MSET (Multiple Set)
`MSET` allows you to set multiple keys at once, saving the overhead of multiple individual commands.

```bash
MSET key1 "value1" key2 "value2" key3 "value3"
```
- This command stores multiple key-value pairs at once, reducing the number of round trips to the Redis server.

##### MGET (Multiple Get)
`MGET` is used to retrieve multiple keys in one go, improving efficiency over multiple `GET` commands.

```bash
MGET key1 key2 key3
```
- This retrieves the values associated with `key1`, `key2`, and `key3`. Redis returns an array of values in the same order.

##### Example: Caching Multiple Items in Production
In a high-performance scenario, you might cache multiple pieces of data at once and retrieve them all in one call:

```bash
MSET user:1:name "Alice" user:1:email "alice@example.com" user:2:name "Bob"
```

Later, retrieve all values in one go:
```bash
MGET user:1:name user:1:email user:2:name
```

---

#### 1.3.7 **Managing Keys in Redis**

##### Delete a Key:
```bash
DEL mykey
```
- Deletes the key `mykey`. In production, this is useful for cleaning up expired cache or old session data.

##### Check if a Key Exists:
```bash
EXISTS mykey
```
- Returns `1` if the key exists, otherwise `0`. This helps avoid unnecessary GET operations.

##### List All Keys (use with caution in production):
```bash
KEYS *
```
- This command retrieves all keys in the database. In production environments, use this command with caution as it can be slow with large datasets.

##### Example: Removing Expired Keys in Production
```bash
DEL session:123  # Clear expired session
```

---

### **Production-Grade Best Practices:**
1. **Expiration & Eviction**: Set expiration times on keys (`EXPIRE`) for automatic cache invalidation. Use `TTL` to monitor expiry and avoid serving stale data.
2. **Use Hashes for Structured Data**: Use Redis hashes for structured data (e.g., user profiles) instead of storing JSON strings. This allows more granular updates (e.g., only updating the email).
3. **Avoid Using KEYS in Production**: The `KEYS` command can be very slow, especially in large databases. Use `SCAN` for production environments if you need to iterate over keys.
4. **Persistent Data**: Use Redis persistence options (`RDB` snapshots or `AOF` logs) for ensuring data durability in production.
5. **Backups**: Regularly back up your Redis data, especially the `AOF` or `RDB` files, to prevent data loss.
6. **Monitor and Optimize**: Regularly monitor Redis performance using `INFO`, `MONITOR`, and benchmarking tools. Redis should be optimized for memory usage and speed, especially in high-traffic applications.

---

Here‚Äôs a detailed and production-grade README for **1.4 Data Structures in Redis**. This will cover the five main Redis data types and provide practical examples and guidance on when to use each one:

---

### 1.4 **Data Structures in Redis**

Redis supports a variety of **data structures**. Choosing the right data type based on your application needs is essential for optimizing performance, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Let‚Äôs look at each data type and when you should use them in production environments.

---

#### **1.4.1 Strings** (Most Basic Data Type)

**Definition**: A **string** is the simplest data type in Redis. It can store any type of data‚Äîtext, numbers, or binary data (like images or files). 

**Use Cases**:
- **Caching**: Store key-value pairs for quick access, like caching API responses or user sessions.
- **Counters**: Store numeric values that can be incremented or decremented (e.g., page views, inventory count).
- **Flags**: Simple binary flags (e.g., "is_logged_in", "is_verified") can be stored as strings.

**Common Commands**:
```bash
SET key "value"       # Store a value under a key
GET key               # Retrieve the value of a key
INCR key              # Increment a numeric value stored as a string
DECR key              # Decrement a numeric value
EXPIRE key 3600       # Set expiration time (1 hour)
```

**Example**:
```bash
SET session:user:123 "user_data"
GET session:user:123
```
- **Production Use**: Use strings for caching HTTP responses or user session data. For instance, storing a cached product detail page or user session token.

---

#### **1.4.2 Lists** (Ordered Collections)

**Definition**: A **list** is a collection of ordered elements. Redis lists are implemented as linked lists, which makes it easy to add and remove items from both ends (head or tail).

**Use Cases**:
- **Queues**: Store jobs, messages, or tasks in a queue (FIFO‚ÄîFirst In First Out).
- **Stacks**: Implement stacks (LIFO‚ÄîLast In First Out).
- **Recent Activity**: Maintain a list of recent actions (e.g., recent search queries, user activity).

**Common Commands**:
```bash
LPUSH key "value"     # Add an element to the head (left) of the list
RPUSH key "value"     # Add an element to the tail (right) of the list
LPOP key              # Remove and return the first element of the list
RPOP key              # Remove and return the last element of the list
LRANGE key 0 -1       # Get all elements from the list (0 to -1 means entire list)
```

**Example**:
```bash
RPUSH task_queue "task1"
LPUSH task_queue "task2"
```
- **Production Use**: Use lists for background job queues. For example, tasks are added to the queue with `RPUSH`, and workers can process them with `LPOP`. In this case, use `RPUSH` for adding items to the queue and `LPOP` for processing tasks.

---

#### **1.4.3 Sets** (Unordered Collections)

**Definition**: A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Redis sets are great for storing data where uniqueness matters, and the order of elements does not.

**Use Cases**:
- **Unique Tags**: Store tags or labels where duplicates should be avoided (e.g., post tags, category labels).
- **User Membership**: Track users who belong to a certain group (e.g., users who liked a post, users who have completed a challenge).
- **Social Networks**: Maintain relationships, like ‚Äúfriends of a user.‚Äù

**Common Commands**:
```bash
SADD key "value"      # Add a member to the set
SREM key "value"      # Remove a member from the set
SMEMBERS key          # Get all members of the set
SISMEMBER key "value" # Check if a member exists in the set (returns 1 or 0)
```

**Example**:
```bash
SADD user:123:tags "redis" "database"
SMEMBERS user:123:tags
```
- **Production Use**: Use sets for managing user interactions. For example, track which users have liked a particular post, as the set will automatically handle duplicates.

---

#### **1.4.4 Hashes** (Key-Value Pairs)

**Definition**: A **hash** in Redis is a map of key-value pairs. It is the perfect data structure to represent objects or structured data, such as user profiles or settings.

**Use Cases**:
- **User Profiles**: Store multiple attributes of a user (e.g., name, email, role).
- **Configuration Settings**: Store configuration data as key-value pairs.
- **Session Data**: Store detailed session or authentication data.

**Common Commands**:
```bash
HSET key field "value"        # Set a field in a hash
HGET key field                # Get the value of a field in a hash
HGETALL key                   # Get all fields and values in a hash
HDEL key field                # Remove a field from a hash
```

**Example**:
```bash
HSET user:123 name "John Doe" age 30 email "john@example.com"
HGETALL user:123
```
- **Production Use**: Store user profile data in hashes, allowing you to update specific fields like email or age without affecting other fields. This is more efficient than using strings to store the entire profile as a serialized object.

---

#### **1.4.5 Sorted Sets** (Ordered Collections with Scores)

**Definition**: A **sorted set** is similar to a set, but each member is associated with a score. The members are ordered by their score in ascending order, which makes sorted sets ideal for scenarios like leaderboards or priority queues.

**Use Cases**:
- **Leaderboards**: Track user scores or rankings (e.g., game scores, sales data).
- **Priority Queues**: Handle tasks where each item has a priority score (e.g., task scheduling).
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Track data that needs to be sorted (e.g., the most popular articles in a news app).

**Common Commands**:
```bash
ZADD key score member         # Add a member with a score to the sorted set
ZREM key member               # Remove a member from the sorted set
ZRANGE key 0 -1               # Get all members of the sorted set (in score order)
ZREVRANGE key 0 -1            # Get members in descending score order
ZSCORE key member             # Get the score of a member
```

**Example**:
```bash
ZADD leaderboard 100 "Alice" 200 "Bob" 150 "Charlie"
ZRANGE leaderboard 0 -1       # Returns ["Alice", "Charlie", "Bob"]
ZSCORE leaderboard "Bob"      # Returns 200
```
- **Production Use**: Use sorted sets for real-time leaderboards, where users‚Äô scores are updated dynamically. The score could be based on time, points, or any other metric. For example, you could rank users based on their score and quickly retrieve the top 10 players using `ZRANGE`.

---

### **When to Use Each Data Type in Production**:
1. **Strings**: Ideal for simple, fast storage of key-value pairs (e.g., session tokens, cached content).
2. **Lists**: Perfect for implementing queues or stacks (e.g., job processing, activity logs).
3. **Sets**: Best for managing unique items or memberships (e.g., unique tags, user interactions).
4. **Hashes**: Optimal for structured objects with multiple fields (e.g., user profiles, product details).
5. **Sorted Sets**: Best for ordered data with scores (e.g., leaderboards, priority queues, real-time analytics).

---

**Production Considerations**:
- **Memory Efficiency**: Redis stores all data in memory. Choosing the correct data structure minimizes memory usage. For instance, use hashes for storing user data instead of serializing them as strings.
- **Scalability**: Some data types (like lists and sets) are naturally more scalable for large datasets. Consider using sorted sets for real-time rankings that need fast lookups and ordering.
- **Persistence**: Redis supports persistence with RDB snapshots and AOF logs. For long-term storage, make sure your Redis instance is configured to handle persistence properly.

---

These data structures, when combined effectively, allow Redis to handle a wide variety of use cases in production systems. Understanding each type‚Äôs strengths and best practices will help you build highly performant and scalable applications.

---

### 1.5 **Redis Persistence**

Redis is primarily an **in-memory database**, but it offers mechanisms to persist data to disk, allowing recovery after a server restart or crash. Redis provides two main persistence options: **RDB (Redis Database)** and **AOF (Append-Only File)**. Understanding how and when to use these is crucial for production-grade setups.

---

#### **1.5.1 RDB (Redis Database)**

**What it is**: RDB persistence creates snapshots of your Redis data at specific intervals. It‚Äôs a point-in-time snapshot that can be saved to disk.

**How it works**:
- Periodically, Redis forks the process to create an RDB file.
- The RDB file is a compact, binary file containing the dataset at the time of the snapshot.
- Redis can reload this RDB file on restart to restore the dataset.

**Use Cases**:
- **Backup**: If you need periodic backups of your dataset (e.g., daily snapshots).
- **Disaster Recovery**: Suitable for applications that can tolerate occasional data loss (depending on snapshot frequency).
- **Performance**: RDB is better for performance during write-heavy operations because it doesn‚Äôt log every change‚Äîjust periodic snapshots.

**Configuration**:
- You can configure the frequency of snapshots in `redis.conf` using the `save` directive. For example:
  ```bash
  save 900 1   # Save the DB if at least 1 key changed in 900 seconds (15 minutes)
  save 300 10  # Save the DB if at least 10 keys changed in 300 seconds (5 minutes)
  ```

**Commands**:
- **Force Snapshot**: `BGSAVE`
- **Check Last Snapshot**: `LASTSAVE`

**Example**:
```bash
BGSAVE           # Trigger an RDB snapshot in the background
LASTSAVE         # Check when the last snapshot was created
```

---

#### **1.5.2 AOF (Append-Only File)**

**What it is**: AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server, appending it to an AOF file. Redis can replay the AOF file on restart to reconstruct the dataset.

**How it works**:
- Every write operation is logged in a file.
- Redis can rewrite the AOF file to optimize storage and remove redundant commands (using the `BGREWRITEAOF` command).
- AOF provides more durability but can lead to larger disk usage and slower performance, as every operation is logged.

**Use Cases**:
- **Data Durability**: Suitable for applications that need to persist data with minimal loss (e.g., financial applications, session data).
- **Real-Time Data**: Great for systems where every operation must be recorded, such as counters, logs, and events.
- **Recovery from Failures**: AOF can ensure that no write is lost, even if Redis crashes immediately before writing to disk.

**Configuration**:
- The AOF behavior is controlled by the `appendonly` directive in `redis.conf`. The following options control how Redis handles AOF:
  ```bash
  appendonly yes         # Enable AOF
  appendfsync everysec   # Sync AOF to disk every second
  appendfsync always     # Sync AOF to disk after every write (slower but safer)
  appendfsync no         # Let the OS decide when to flush AOF (fastest, but can lose data)
  ```

**Commands**:
- **Rewrite AOF File**: `BGREWRITEAOF`
- **Check AOF Status**: `AOF`
- **Enable/Disable AOF**: `CONFIG SET appendonly yes|no`

**Example**:
```bash
BGREWRITEAOF     # Rewrite the AOF file in the background to reduce its size
AOF              # Check the status of AOF persistence
```

---

#### **1.5.3 RDB vs AOF**

| Feature            | **RDB**                                      | **AOF**                                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Durability**     | Less durable (data may be lost between snapshots) | More durable (every write operation is logged) |
| **Performance**    | Better performance (no writes to disk for each command) | Slower due to logging every operation        |
| **File Size**      | Smaller (only snapshots)                     | Larger (logs every write operation)           |
| **Recovery Speed** | Faster (smaller snapshots)                   | Slower (AOF file needs to be replayed)        |
| **Backup Frequency** | Periodic (configurable)                     | Every write operation                        |

---

#### **1.5.4 Hybrid Persistence (RDB + AOF)**

Redis allows you to use **both** RDB and AOF together for a balanced approach to persistence.

**How it works**:
- You can configure Redis to use RDB snapshots for periodic backups and AOF for real-time data durability.
- This ensures that Redis can recover quickly using RDB while having a more durable log of every operation with AOF.

**Configuration**:
- Enable both persistence methods by setting `appendonly yes` and configuring the `save` directive for RDB.
- Redis will first use the RDB snapshot for a quick recovery, then apply the AOF log to catch up on changes that occurred since the snapshot.

---

#### **1.5.5 Persistence in Production**

When deciding which persistence method to use in a production environment, consider the following:

- **For Caching Systems**: Use RDB for periodic backups and rely on memory for fast access. You can afford to lose some data in case of failure.
- **For Real-Time Applications**: Use AOF for maximum durability, especially if you need to ensure no data is lost.
- **For Balanced Systems**: Use both RDB and AOF together to take advantage of both faster recovery (RDB) and durability (AOF).
  
**Tip**: For high-availability setups, Redis **Cluster** and **Sentinel** can be used alongside persistence to ensure data availability and reliability.

---

### **Best Practices**:
- **Memory Considerations**: The more data you store, the larger the AOF and RDB files will be. Monitor memory usage and optimize persistence settings accordingly.
- **Data Recovery Testing**: Periodically test the recovery process using RDB or AOF backups to ensure your recovery procedures are effective.
- **Background Persistence**: Use `BGSAVE` and `BGREWRITEAOF` for non-blocking persistence operations, especially in production environments where uptime is crucial.

By configuring and understanding Redis persistence options, you can ensure data durability without compromising performance in your production system.

---

### 1.6 **Key Expiry and Eviction Policies**

In Redis, you can set **expiration** times for keys to ensure they are automatically deleted after a certain period. Redis also provides several **eviction policies** to control what happens when the memory limit is reached. Understanding how expiration and eviction work is essential for building scalable and memory-efficient systems.

---

#### **1.6.1 Key Expiry**

**What it is**: Key expiration allows you to set a time-to-live (TTL) for a key. Once the TTL expires, the key is automatically deleted from Redis.

**Common Commands**:
- **EXPIRE**: Set an expiration time for a key in seconds.
  ```bash
  EXPIRE key seconds   # Sets TTL of a key in seconds
  ```

- **TTL**: Get the remaining TTL of a key.
  ```bash
  TTL key              # Returns the remaining TTL (in seconds) of the key
  ```

- **PERSIST**: Remove the expiration from a key, making it persistent again.
  ```bash
  PERSIST key          # Removes the expiration from the key, making it permanent
  ```

- **SET with EX and PX**: You can set a key with an expiration time directly using the `SET` command.
  ```bash
  SET key "value" EX 60     # Set the key with a 60-second TTL
  SET key "value" PX 1000   # Set the key with a 1000-millisecond TTL
  ```

**Example**:
```bash
SET session:user:123 "active" EX 3600  # Session key expires in 1 hour
TTL session:user:123  # Returns TTL in seconds (3600)
```

**Use Cases**:
- **Session Management**: Store session tokens with an expiration time.
- **Cache Expiration**: Cache data with an automatic expiry to ensure it doesn't stay in memory longer than necessary.
- **Temporary Data**: Store temporary information like one-time passwords (OTPs), tokens, or links that should expire after use.

---

#### **1.6.2 Redis Eviction Policies**

Eviction policies determine what Redis does when it runs out of memory. These policies control which keys Redis should remove when it needs to free up space. You can configure eviction policies based on your application's needs.

**Common Eviction Policies**:
- **noeviction**: Returns an error when the memory limit is reached. No keys are evicted.
- **volatile-lru**: Removes the least recently used (LRU) key with an expiration set (i.e., only keys that have an expiration time).
- **allkeys-lru**: Removes the least recently used (LRU) key, regardless of whether it has an expiration time.
- **volatile-random**: Removes a random key with an expiration set.
- **allkeys-random**: Removes a random key, regardless of expiration time.
- **volatile-ttl**: Removes the key with the shortest remaining TTL (time-to-live).
- **lru**: Least recently used eviction policy.
- **ttl**: Evicts the key with the shortest TTL.

**Configuration**:
- You can configure the eviction policy in the `redis.conf` file using the `maxmemory-policy` directive. For example:
  ```bash
  maxmemory-policy volatile-lru       # Only evict keys with an expiration time based on LRU
  maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru        # Evict any key based on LRU (whether it has an expiration or not)
  ```

- **maxmemory**: You must also configure the `maxmemory` directive to set a memory limit. Redis will start evicting keys when the memory usage exceeds this limit.
  ```bash
  maxmemory 2gb    # Limit Redis to 2GB of memory
  maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru  # Evict keys based on LRU if memory limit is reached
  ```

**Eviction Examples**:

1. **volatile-lru**: When memory is full, Redis will remove the least recently used key, but only if that key has an expiration set.
   ```bash
   maxmemory-policy volatile-lru
   ```

2. **allkeys-lru**: In this policy, Redis will evict the least recently used key, regardless of whether it has an expiration set.
   ```bash
   maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
   ```

3. **volatile-ttl**: Redis will remove the key with the shortest TTL when the memory limit is reached.
   ```bash
   maxmemory-policy volatile-ttl
   ```

4. **noeviction**: No eviction will occur. Redis will return an error when the memory limit is reached, and no keys will be removed.
   ```bash
   maxmemory-policy noeviction
   ```

#### **1.6.3 When to Use Which Eviction Policy**

- **volatile-lru**: Use when you only want to evict keys that are meant to expire (i.e., cache items). This is useful when you need to ensure that only keys with a TTL will be evicted.
- **allkeys-lru**: Use when you want Redis to evict the least recently used keys, regardless of whether they have an expiration. Good for general cache scenarios where older keys should be evicted.
- **volatile-random**: Use when you need to evict keys randomly and only want to evict keys that have an expiration set. This might be useful for situations where you don‚Äôt care about the eviction order, but you still want to preserve some expired keys.
- **allkeys-random**: Use when you need to evict keys randomly without considering whether they have an expiration. This can be useful for very general cache eviction where you have no preference for which keys get evicted.
- **volatile-ttl**: Use when you want to prioritize evicting keys that are about to expire. This ensures that Redis keeps keys that have a long TTL and evicts those that are near expiration.

#### **1.6.4 Key Expiry in Production**

- **Session Expiry**: Use key expiry for user sessions to automatically delete inactive sessions and avoid memory bloat.
- **Cache Expiry**: Set cache TTLs based on data volatility. For example, set a shorter TTL for frequently changing data and a longer TTL for more static data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Store rate limit counters in Redis with an expiration to automatically reset the count after a period (e.g., per minute or per hour).
- **Job Queueing**: Use expiration for background jobs or tasks that should only exist for a limited time (e.g., temporary tokens or job timeouts).

---

### **Best Practices**:
- **Monitor Expiry**: Use the `TTL` command to monitor key expiration and ensure that TTLs are set correctly for your use case.
- **Choose the Right Eviction Policy**: Select the eviction policy based on your data access patterns. For example, `allkeys-lru` works well for caching, while `volatile-lru` is better for situations where only expired keys should be evicted.
- **Memory Management**: Set appropriate memory limits using the `maxmemory` directive. Redis can become slow if it starts to hit memory limits, so configure memory limits and eviction policies based on your application‚Äôs needs.

By effectively using key expiry and eviction policies, you can optimize memory usage and ensure that Redis performs efficiently in production.
