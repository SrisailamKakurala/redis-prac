   - Setting up Redis Cluster
   - Redis Sentinel for high availability

### **Phase 3: Advanced Redis (Production-Grade Concepts)**
1. **Advanced Caching Strategies**
   - Cache invalidation techniques
   - Cache expiration vs. eviction
   - TTL and lazy expiration

2. **Redis in Distributed Systems**
   - Data replication, sharding, and partitioning
   - Consistency models in Redis

3. **Monitoring and Performance Optimization**
   - Redis monitoring commands (`INFO`, `MONITOR`, `CLIENT LIST`)

4. **Security and Authentication**
   - Redis security mechanisms (passwords, ACLs)
   - Configuring SSL/TLS encryption

5. **Backup and Restoration Strategies**
   - Taking backups of Redis data
   - Restoring data from RDB/AOF backups

6. **Redis and Data Consistency**
   - Redis as a queue (Reliable Queues, FIFO)

   - WebSocket integration with Redis Pub/Sub

### **Phase 5: Redis with Python**
1. **Setting Up Redis with Python**
   - Installing and setting up `redis-py`
   - Basic Redis commands in Python

2. **Caching with Redis in Python**
   - Using Redis to cache data in a Flask or Django app
